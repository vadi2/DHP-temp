This IG is version 5.0.0, while the IG 'fhir.dicom' is from version 4.0.1 
The ImplementationGuide is based on FHIR version 5.0.0 but package fhir.dicom#2025.2.20250411 is based on FHIR version 4.0.1. In general, this version mismatch should be avoided - some tools will try to make this work with variable degrees of success, but others will not even try

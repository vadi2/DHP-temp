### In development
Canonical URLs have been changed to `https://dhp.uz/fhir/core` for conformance resources and `https://terminology.dhp.uz/fhir/core` for terminology resources to accomodate further IGs, which will follow a pattern of `https://dhp.uz/fhir/<ig>`.

### Version 0.2.0

This is a first, in-development release of the IG that updates the canonical URLs of all resources to their final version.

#### Major changes
UZ Core profiles for AuditEvent, Consent, Condition, HealthcareService, Location, Organization, Patient, Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Provenance and the Socioeconomic Observation have been added.

Canonical URLs of profiles, terminology resources, and the IG have been changed from the temporary `medcore.uz` domain to the official `dhp.uz` domain.
